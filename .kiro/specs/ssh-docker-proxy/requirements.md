# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SSH Docker Proxy is a standalone Go library and CLI tool that creates a transparent proxy between local Docker clients and remote Docker daemons over SSH connections. This tool enables developers to seamlessly use their local Docker CLI and tools against remote Docker instances while maintaining full compatibility with all Docker features through pure raw HTTP traffic relaying, avoiding the need to re-implement Docker-specific logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run Docker commands locally that execute on a remote server via SSH, so that I can leverage remote compute resources while maintaining my familiar local workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `docker ps` against the proxy socket THEN the system SHALL forward the raw HTTP request bytes to the remote Docker daemon via SSH and return the response unchanged
2. WHEN a user specifies a local socket path THEN the system SHALL create a Unix domain socket at that location that accepts standard Docker API connections
3. WHEN the proxy receives any Docker API request THEN the system SHALL relay the raw HTTP traffic bidirectionally using pure byte copying without Docker-specific parsing
4. WHEN multiple Docker commands are run concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle multiple simultaneous connections with separate SSH streams per connection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure SSH connection parameters for the proxy, so that I can connect to different remote hosts with appropriate authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides SSH host, user, and key file parameters THEN the system SHALL establish an SSH connection using those credentials
2. WHEN the SSH connection fails THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message and not start the proxy
3. WHEN a user specifies a remote Docker socket path THEN the system SHALL connect to that specific socket on the remote host
4. IF no remote socket path is specified THEN the system SHALL default to `/var/run/docker.sock`

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the proxy to verify the remote Docker daemon is accessible before starting, so that I can catch configuration issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the proxy starts THEN the system SHALL perform a health check to verify the remote Docker daemon is accessible
2. IF the remote Docker daemon is unreachable THEN the system SHALL exit with an error message
3. WHEN the health check succeeds THEN the system SHALL log the successful connection
4. WHEN performing the health check THEN the system MAY use the Docker Go SDK for API version negotiation if beneficial

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the proxy as both a library and a CLI tool, so that I can integrate it into other applications or use it standalone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN imported as a Go library THEN the system SHALL expose a clean API for programmatic proxy creation
2. WHEN used as a CLI tool THEN the system SHALL accept command-line flags for all configuration options
3. WHEN used as a library THEN the system SHALL allow custom SSH client configuration
4. WHEN the proxy is stopped THEN the system SHALL clean up the local socket file and close all connections gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can troubleshoot connection issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the proxy encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including context
2. WHEN connections are established or closed THEN the system SHALL log connection lifecycle events
3. WHEN SSH authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about the authentication failure
4. WHEN the proxy is running THEN the system SHALL log successful startup with configuration details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the proxy to support all Docker features including streaming operations, so that commands like `docker exec`, `docker logs -f`, and `docker build` work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs streaming Docker commands THEN the system SHALL maintain persistent bidirectional streams
2. WHEN a user runs `docker exec -it` THEN the system SHALL properly handle interactive terminal sessions
3. WHEN a user runs `docker build` with large contexts THEN the system SHALL handle large file uploads correctly
4. WHEN a user runs `docker logs -f` THEN the system SHALL stream logs in real-time without buffering delays
