# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DockBridge is a simplified Go-based system that enables seamless Docker development workflows by automatically provisioning Hetzner Cloud servers on-demand and using the ssh-docker-proxy library for transparent Docker command forwarding. The system focuses on cost optimization through intelligent server lifecycle management while providing a simple, reliable user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run Docker commands locally that automatically execute on remote Hetzner servers, so that I can leverage cloud compute resources without manual server management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `dockbridge start` THEN the system SHALL initialize but NOT provision servers until Docker commands are executed
2. WHEN a user runs a Docker command THEN the system SHALL automatically provision a Hetzner server if none exists
3. WHEN the server is provisioned THEN the system SHALL use ssh-docker-proxy to forward Docker commands transparently
4. WHEN Docker commands complete THEN the system SHALL return results exactly as if running locally
5. WHEN multiple Docker commands are run THEN they SHALL all use the same provisioned server

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want servers to be automatically destroyed when I'm not using them, so that I minimize cloud costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my laptop screen is locked THEN the system SHALL detect the lock within 30 seconds
2. WHEN a screen lock is detected THEN the system SHALL initiate server shutdown after a 5-minute grace period
3. WHEN shutting down servers THEN the system SHALL preserve persistent volumes for future use
4. WHEN the laptop is unlocked within the grace period THEN the system SHALL cancel the shutdown
5. WHEN no Docker commands are run for 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically destroy the server

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want persistent storage for my Docker containers, so that my data survives server reprovisioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN provisioning a server THEN the system SHALL create and attach a persistent volume
2. WHEN a server is destroyed THEN the system SHALL preserve the volume
3. WHEN reprovisioning a server THEN the system SHALL reattach the existing volume
4. WHEN volume operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN volumes are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL provide commands to clean them up

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple configuration and setup, so that I can start using DockBridge quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN first running DockBridge THEN the system SHALL guide me through initial configuration
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN I SHALL only need to provide Hetzner API token and basic preferences
3. WHEN SSH keys don't exist THEN the system SHALL generate them automatically
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggestions
5. WHEN updating configuration THEN changes SHALL take effect without requiring restart

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable connection handling, so that temporary network issues don't disrupt my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect with exponential backoff
2. WHEN SSH connections fail THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before failing
3. WHEN Docker commands fail due to connectivity THEN the system SHALL retry transparently
4. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL resume normal operation automatically
5. WHEN connection issues persist THEN the system SHALL provide clear status information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and status information, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log structured messages with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context
3. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status of servers, connections, and operations
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL support verbose logging modes
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL log timing and resource usage information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple CLI interface, so that I can easily control DockBridge operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running CLI commands THEN the system SHALL provide clear help text and usage examples
2. WHEN checking status THEN the CLI SHALL show server state, connection health, and cost information
3. WHEN managing servers THEN the CLI SHALL provide commands to start, stop, and destroy servers manually
4. WHEN viewing logs THEN the CLI SHALL support real-time log streaming and filtering
5. WHEN commands fail THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be lightweight and fast, so that it doesn't slow down my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting DockBridge THEN it SHALL initialize in under 2 seconds
2. WHEN forwarding Docker commands THEN latency SHALL be minimal (under 100ms overhead)
3. WHEN provisioning servers THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback
4. WHEN the system is idle THEN it SHALL use minimal local resources
5. WHEN handling multiple operations THEN performance SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with existing Docker workflows, so that I can use DockBridge with my current tools and scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DockBridge is running THEN all existing Docker commands SHALL work without modification
2. WHEN using Docker Compose THEN it SHALL work transparently with remote servers
3. WHEN using Docker build contexts THEN large files SHALL be transferred efficiently
4. WHEN using interactive Docker commands THEN they SHALL work exactly as locally
5. WHEN integrating with CI/CD THEN DockBridge SHALL support automated workflows

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cost visibility and control, so that I can manage my cloud spending effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN servers are running THEN the system SHALL track and display estimated costs
2. WHEN viewing status THEN the CLI SHALL show current monthly cost estimates
3. WHEN servers have been running for extended periods THEN the system SHALL warn about costs
4. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide cost reports and usage statistics
5. WHEN cost limits are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce them by destroying servers
